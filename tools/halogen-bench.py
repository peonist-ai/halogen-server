"""halogen-bench — llama-bench-shaped sweep over halogen's HTTP endpoint.

    halogen-bench -p 512,2048,8192 -n 128 -d dflash2,mtp -r 3

Why this exists alongside tools/bench-serving.py — they answer different
questions and BOTH are needed:

    bench-serving.py   ten REAL prompt shapes, the number of record for
                       "how fast is this in practice". Prompt-shaped, so it
                       measures acceptance as users actually experience it.
    halogen-bench.py   a SIZE SWEEP at fixed synthetic lengths, so a number
                       can be put next to llama-bench's pp/tg table for the
                       same model on the same box. Comparable, not realistic.

Do not quote one where the other belongs. A pp2048 figure is not a chat
throughput figure and never was.

Everything goes over HTTP to /v1/chat/completions — chat template, tokenizer,
scheduler, engine. An engine-side harness measures a different thing (it skips
the whole front end), and this project has already misread an engine-side
fixture number as a serving number more than once.

Stdlib only, so it runs inside the release image, on the box, or from a
laptop pointed at a remote endpoint.
